{
  "if" : {
      <condition> | <logical operator>
  },
  "then" : {
      "effect" : "deny | audit | append"
  }
}

The supported logical operators along with the syntax are listed below:
Operator Name 	Syntax
Not 	"not" : {<condition or operator >}
And 	"allOf" : [ {<condition or operator >},{<condition or operator >}]
Or 	"anyOf" : [ {<condition or operator >},{<condition or operator >}]

Resource Manager enables you to specify complex logic in your policy through nested operators. For example, you can deny resource creation in a particular location for a specified resource type. An example of nested operators is shown below.


Conditions

A condition evaluates whether a field or source meets certain criteria. The supported condition names and syntax are listed below:
Condition Name 	Syntax
Equals 	"equals" : "<value>"
Like 	"like" : "<value>"
Contains 	"contains" : "<value>"
In 	"in" : [ "<value1>","<value2>" ]
ContainsKey 	"containsKey" : "<keyName>"
Fields

Conditions are formed through the use of fields and sources. A field represents properties in the resource request payload that is used to describe the state of the resource. A source represents characteristics of the request itself.

The following fields and sources are supported:

Fields: name, kind, type, location, tags, tags.*, and property alias.
